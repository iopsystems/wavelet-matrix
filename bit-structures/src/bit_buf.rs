// A plain fixed-size bitvector with no acceleration structures, backed by an array of integers.
// Supports random bit read and write. Intended as a data representation for dense bitvectors.
// Not designed for general fixed-width encoding; we can use the bitbuffer library for that.
// todo:
// - customizable backing integer type (feels useful to be able to change the block type)
//   - implement T.bits() for u16, u32, u64;
//   - see simple-sds split_at_index for how they handle it; maybe we want a T.mask() also for offset masking
//   - see also my similar block_index_and_offset
// - add as many debug_assert! s as is reasonable to do

use crate::bit_block::BitBlock;
use crate::utils::div_ceil;

// todo:
// - add a builder so that we can RLE the start and end of the bitvector, only storing the middle chunk.
//   - not entirely sure how best to do this
//     - a trim() method on RawBitVec? then we can't set beyond the trimmed after
//     - a builder that preallocates the full thing and trims on build?
//     - a builder that reallocates as you go?
//     - or if the ones are sorted, can just look at the first and last.
// - [same idea, refined] implement a "default value" that we can compress out of the top and bottom â€“ or maybe always zero.
//   ie., store only the middle section and return the default value outside it.

// todo:
// - is there an elegant way to generalize this to arbitrary unsigned types?
// - is there a specific choice that works well with wasm and wasm simd?
// - current thoughts: we can use the BitBlock trait to centralize common functionality
//   across block types, and type aliases to fix the individual block types for each
//   individual bitvector type and block.
// pub type B = u32; // B type

// todo: rename this to BitBuffer?
